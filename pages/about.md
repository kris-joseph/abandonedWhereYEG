## About the Collection

Photos in this collection were casually gathered in the summer of 2012 in response to an observation that the streets of downtown Edmonton, Alberta were often decorated by abandoned items of clothing.

This site is technically a demo of a great tool called [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), but I admit I've always been curious about questions of how these items ended up where they are and how they correlate with issues faced by unhomed people in the downtown core.

All photos were taken with an iPhone camera, and the benefit of that approach is that each photo is dated and tagged with a physical location. That makes this odd collection of photos a great sample data set to use for CollectionBuilder, because it gives the map and timeline some data to work with!
